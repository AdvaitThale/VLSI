# VLSI
### Contains Simulation, Verification, Generated Reports and files of individual/cascaded VLSI components written in VHDL.
---
* `Vivado` : Contains all the project files e.g. ALU, CMOS designs.       
* `CMOS Layout` : Inside is the CMOS layout drawing tool. Uses Microwind 3.1.    
      - `Layouts` : Contains all the previously drawn layouts

 <i>`NOTE:` Codes and simulations are developed in AMD Vivado 2023.1 and are written in VHDL. </i>     
 Open the `.srcs` folder of respective project to access the Simulation and Source Code.            
 Access `.sim` folder for behavioural schematic, test waveform/s and logs
